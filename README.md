Golang queues lib.  
Queue is able to accept pushes and execute one item after another.  
Timeouts and channel to cancel the item are supported.  
Also, special method exists to clear the queue.  
It wasn't easy for me to create implementation with all these features and good quality.  
Hopefully it will be useful for somebody :)  
However for now it is not tested well in prod so i do not recommend to use it in prod.  

Questions?
